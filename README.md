There are two Python Jupyter Notebook scripts:

1)  WeatherPy_SLandis:  retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a list of cities based on a list of randomly genterated Latitudes and Longitudes.
     The script then generates some scatter plots to look at correlations within the weather data.

2)  Reads data from a csv file and map plots the city data.  Then the data is limited to ideal vacation weather and plotted again to show ideal vacation locations on a map plot.
